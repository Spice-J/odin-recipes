<h2>Description</h2>

    <p>These healthy chicken enchiladas are packed with flavor and nutritious ingredients! 
    The homemade enchilada sauce is the star of this recipe.
    I don’t know what it is but I love Mexican food. Maybe it’s the spice or 
    just the overall flavor profile but I love the cuisine! I have a vegetarian 
    enchilada bake but hadn’t shared a straight forward enchilada recipe… until 
    now. I love this recipe and hope it becomes a staple with your families!</p>
