<h2>Description</h2>

    <p>These healthy chicken enchiladas are packed with flavor and nutritious ingredients! 
    The homemade enchilada sauce is the star of this recipe.
    I don’t know what it is but I love Mexican food. Maybe it’s the spice or 
    just the overall flavor profile but I love the cuisine! I have a vegetarian 
    enchilada bake but hadn’t shared a straight forward enchilada recipe… until 
    now. I love this recipe and hope it becomes a staple with your families!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Whole wheat flour tortillas</li>
        <li>Homemade red enchilada sauce</li>
        <li>Shredded Chicken</li>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>spices</li>
        <li>Toppings - scallions, cilantro, jalapenos</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan over medium heat, add oil and sauté garlic until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Add chipotle peppers, adobo sauce, tomato sauce, oregano, chili powder, cumin, broth, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5-10 minutes. This will help thicken the sauce. Set aside until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°F degrees.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté onions and garlic until soft and translucent, about 4-5 minutes. Add chicken, corn, black beans, cilantro, chili powder, cumin and 1/2 cup enchilada sauce to the skillet. Stir to combine and cook for another 4-5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Spray a 13 by 9-inch glass baking dish with non-stick spray. Fill each tortillas with 1/4- 1/3 cup of the chicken and black bean mixture, a sprinkle of cheese and roll it up.</li>
        <li>Place rolled tortilla into the baking dish, seam side down. Once all the tortillas are filled, cover with remaining sauce and sprinkle remaining shredded cheese over top.</li>
        <li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake in the oven on the middle rack for 20-25 minutes or until cheese is melted and enchiladas are warm throughout. Serve enchiladas with your toppings of choice: green onions, fresh cilantro, jalapeños, sliced avocado and Greek yogurt and/or sour cream.</li>
